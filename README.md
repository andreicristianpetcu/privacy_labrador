You can now use DuckDuckGo as your default search engine and when DDG misses the results, a handy google link is presented in the page.

FEATURES:
- shows the tab that points to Google results in the Duck Duck Go results page;
- it jump to the Google results with Shift+Alt+G if you are on Duck Duck Go results page;
- If you type "g some search term" in the awesome bar it will go directly to Google's "some search term" results page.
- it can temporarily reset your current search engine and always redirect to google when you tap Shift+Alt+A. This is useful when you pair program with people that don't like DDG or QWant.

I'm currently working on rudimentary qwant.com support. It's still buggy in Qwant.
